analyze_datasharing
===================

Playing with the github api against jtleeks datasharing repository

family.html shows all the plots and some of the code used to generate them.

This first commit is extremely ugly
--------------------
checkforks.R downloads the data via github api

procdata.r munges the data a bit and produces some plots
